# Secret_Auction
Secret auction using python  that allows multiple participants to secretly submit their bids for an item without revealing their amounts to others. The program collects each bidderâ€™s name and bid, stores them securely (usually in a dictionary), and after all bids are entered, it determines and announces the highest bidder and winning amount.
